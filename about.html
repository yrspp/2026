        <h1>About YRSPP</h1>
        <h2>Scientific & societal impact </h2>
        <p>The goal of YRSPP is to facilitate the exchange of cutting-edge plant photobiology research among
            early-career researchers (ECRs) and provide networking opportunities to promote international collaboration
        </p>
        <p>The primary goal of YRSPP is to facilitate the exchange of cutting-edge research in plant photobiology among
            ECRs on a low-pressure international stage. The spotlight will be on them. ECRs will deliver talks and
            present posters of their work, allowing them to showcase their findings and receive constructive feedback
            from peers, including senior researchers like <b>Professor Ute Höcker</b> and <b> Professor Kerry
                Franklin</b>. This central focus on ECR participation underscores our commitment to nurturing the
            careers of young and upcoming investigators in the field. Keynote speeches by newly appointed assistant
            professors and group leaders (currently being shortlisted) will offer attendees the opportunity to gain
            insights into successful academic trajectories and build valuable research connections. </p>

        <p>Plant photobiology is of international importance as it intersects with critical global challenges like
            climate change, food security, sustainable agriculture and renewable energy. Understanding how plants
            respond to light - and how these responses affect their growth, development, and adaptation to changing
            environmental conditions - will underpin crucial innovations in crop productivity, ecosystem resilience and
            new biotechnology. The research that will be discussed at YRSPP events has the potential to drive these
            innovations by fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange among ECRs, helping to propel the
            international community towards groundbreaking discoveries and sustainable solutions to pressing global
            challenges. By engaging senior researchers and assistant professors, YRSPP reinforces its commitment to
            mentorship and knowledge transfer, equipping early-career investigators with the connections and skills to
            make a lasting impact on plant photobiology research on a global scale. </p>

        <h2>Our history</h2>
        <p>The Young Researchers Symposium on Plant Photobiology (YRSPP) originated in early 2018 in a conference centre
            elevator in Matsue, Japan, where frustrated PhD students discussed the limited involvement of young
            scientists in the significant International Symposium on Plant Photobiology (ISPP). To address this gap, the
            first YRSPP was organised in Cologne later that year and facilitated successful networking between more than
            50 young researchers. Subsequently, a team formed over drinks decided to organise a second YRSPP for 2020,
            which had to be postponed to 2022 due to the pandemic. The next team organised another highly successful
            event in Utrecht in 2024, continuing to create a supportive environment to connect and collaborate with the
            goal of advancing photobiology research. A new team is now organising YRSPP 2026 in the same spirit, and
            we're looking forward to welcoming the next cohort of ECRs in Edinburgh!</p>

        <p>Since very few of the current organisers will be in this space two years from now, we are actively looking
            for people to pass the torch to. If you’d like to find out what’s involved in organising the next YRSPP,
            please reach out to us and we will be happy to answer all your questions!</p>

        <h2>Organising committee for 2026</h2>

        <h4>Amy Newell - University of Edinburgh, UK</h4>
        <p>I am a PhD student in Karen Halliday's lab, where I investigate how light controls protein translation.</p>

        <h4>Hannah Walters - University of Glasgow, UK</h4>
        <p>I'm a PhD student in John Christie's lab, where I'm studying the molecular mechanism of blue-light signal
            transduction by phototropins and NPH3 and their role in seedling phototropism. </p>

        <h4>Ira Trivedi - University of Köln, DE</h4>
        <p>I am a PhD student in Ute Höcker's lab, where I investigate how photoreceptor interaction with SPA1 leads to
            the inactivation of the COP1/SPA complex, promoting photomorphogenesis.</p>

        <h4>Marissa Valdivia-Cabrera - University of Edinburgh, UK</h4>
        <p>I'm a post-doctoral research associate in Karen Halliday's lab, and I investigate the function of phytochrome
            A as a canopy-depth sensor which helps plants detect shading by other vegetation.</p>

        <h4>Mengke (Lavender) Zhou - University of Edinburgh, UK</h4>
        <p>I am a PhD student in Karen Halliday's lab. I am interested in how plants navigate shade in
            nature.</p>
