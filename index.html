    <h1>Welcome to YRSPP 2026! </h1>
    <a href="/contact.html">contact</a>
<p>We are excited to invite you to Edinburgh, Scotland's capital city, for the fourth edition of the Young Researchers' Symposium on Plant Photobiology (YRSPP).</p>
<p>YRSPP is designed for (and organised by) early-career researchers (ECRs) in the field of plant photobiology, and YRSPP 2026 will be a gathering of young researchers investigating the ways plants perceive, transduce and integrate light and circadian signals in their development and growth. </p>
<p>The primary goal of YRSPP is to showcase the cutting-edge work of young plant photobiologists, offering networking opportunities to promote international cross-disciplinary collaboration, knowledge exchange and innovation in plant photobiology. This comes at a crucial juncture in the advancement of plant science research, as numerous global challenges highlight the need to harness the potential of plants. </p>
