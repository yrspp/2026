    <h1>YRSPP 2026 sponsors</h1>
    <p>Sponsor logos coming soon.</p>

    <h1 id="sponsor-yrspp-2026">Want to add your logo here?</h1>

    <h2>YRSPP events are made possible by sponsors like you.</h2>
    <p>Our previous events in Germany, the Netherlands and online flourished thanks to generous sponsorship from
        both academia and industry. We are excited to collaborate with you to inspire the future of plant
        photobiology research in Edinburgh next year at YRSPP 2026.</p>
    <p>YRSPP 2026 will attract more than 50 motivated early-career researchers (ECRs) at formative stages of their
        careers, who are in the process of selecting their career paths and making decisions on the companies people
        they will rely on for years to come. Positive perceptions of your brand or institution will be passed on to
        their current and future lab groups as well, and could encourage future collaboration or inspire their
        career choices. </p>
